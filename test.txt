Prints the formatted representation of object on stream, followed by a newline. If stream is None, sys.stdout is used. This may be used in the interactive interpreter instead of the print() function for inspecting values (you can even reassign print = pprint.pprint for use within a scope). indent, width and depth will be passed to the PrettyPrinter constructor as formatting parameters.
